This is a drop-in replacement for the Haskell [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base) library, meant to be used with 
[Liquid Haskell](http://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/).

This package simply re-exports all the `base` modules, but it also provides LH refinements for some of them.
